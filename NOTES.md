# Notes

I'm kinda forgetful, so this is to save my thoughts and headspace into secondary storage.

First things first, I need to figure out how to draw the lattice points and polygons. Godot has a _draw_polygon() function that can be used inside the _draw() function, so start experimenting with that when I get into actually implementing stuff.

So far, I've got the entire development environment set up, repo is up, kanban bakclog is... getting in shape. My goal at the moment is at the very, very least, implement bullet point 1 from the preliminar work plan, so being able to render a polygon and slice it with the different types of cutting planes from the original demo.

It doesn't *have* to look good yet, just be functional. That being said, I have a broad idea of the aesthetic I want to go for. **Vector graphics inspired**. Somewhere inbetween a 3blue1brown video and Superhexagon or Tempest.

I have until 2024-07-8 (final report deadline). Ideally, that report should be in a presentable shape by 2024-07-01.

Also, I know I'm pretty late to this, but this past month has been ROUGH. Hopefully I can keep up the pace.

Thankfully next week's recess. I'll have more time then. Even so, I should really get to implementing ASAP. Not today though, I'm very tired.
